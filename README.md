# Road-Accident-Analysis---PowerBI

## Project Objective

The primary objective of the UK Road Accident Analysis Power BI dashboard project is to provide stakeholders, including government agencies, law enforcement, and road safety advocates, with a comprehensive and visually insightful tool for understanding and addressing road safety concerns in the United Kingdom. This project aims to analyze historical road accident data, identifying key trends, hotspots, and contributing factors to accidents, such as weather conditions, road types, and vehicle types involved. By doing so, the dashboard will assist in making data-driven decisions to improve road safety measures, reduce accident rates, and ultimately save lives on UK roads.

## Data Description

This UK Road Accident Dataset has multiple features about casualties happened in UK country which can be useful to perform an in-depth analysis. This analysis can be useful in preventing the road-accidents or know the root causes of an accident.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and it contains the details of every recorded accident in the UK from 2005 till 2015. The full dataset is divided into three major categories i.e. accident information, casualty information, and vehicle information.

4. Age groups 11-15 years, 26-35 years and 36-45 years have the similar number of accident records and the major day of accidents for these age groups is Saturday.
5. Warrington(WA) and Guildford(GU) have more accidents on Tuesdays and the most common age group of people causing accidents is 46 to 55 years.

## Future Scope

The future scope of the UK Road Accident Analysis Power BI dashboard project holds significant potential for expansion and enhancement. Firstly, the project can incorporate real-time data feeds to provide up-to-the-minute accident information, enabling immediate response and interventions. Additionally, predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms can be integrated to forecast accident-prone areas and suggest proactive safety measures. Furthermore, the dashboard can be extended to include socio-economic factors and demographic data to gain deeper insights into the root causes of accidents, facilitating more targeted policy interventions. Collaboration with other European countries for comparative analysis and the development of a cross-border accident analysis system is another exciting possibility. Overall, the project's future scope involves continuous refinement, automation, and broadening its utility to make UK roads safer and more resilient. 

Some most common areas where this project can be helpful are:-

1. Ministry of Transport
2. Road transport Department
3. Police Force
4. Emergency Service Department
5. Road Safety Corps
6. Transport Operators
7. Traffic Management Agencies
8. Public
9. Media

## Challenges

Writing optimized complex DAX queries to simplify  and create simple curated tables to simplify the analysis process and fasten the graphical processing speed was a tough challenge in this project.

## Key Learnings

The UK Road Accident Analysis Power BI project taught me that data-driven decision-making is powerful. It showed how historical accident data can shape road safety policies. Data visualization is crucial for understanding complex information, and a holistic approach to accident analysis is necessary, considering factors like weather, road conditions, vehicle types, and human behavior. Scalability is key, and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for effective communication. Overall, the project's most important lesson is its potential to enhance public safety by reducing road accidents and saving lives through evidence-based decision-making.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the UK Road Accident Analysis Power BI dashboard project has been a journey of data-driven discovery and insight. Through meticulous analysis and visualization, we've gained a deeper understanding of road accidents in the United Kingdom, identifying key trends and factors contributing to these incidents. The project's success underscores the importance of harnessing data to inform policy decisions and drive road safety improvements. As we look to the future, the project's potential for expansion and enhancement is clear, with opportunities for real-time data integration, predictive analytics, and cross-border collaboration. Ultimately, this project serves as a valuable tool in the ongoing effort to make UK roads safer and more resilient, with the ultimate goal of reducing accidents and safeguarding lives.
